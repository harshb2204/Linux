An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Key functions of an operating system include:

- Process Management: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes
- Memory Management: Allocating and managing memory for programs
- File System Management: Handling file operations and storage
- Device Management: Controlling and coordinating hardware devices
- Security: Managing user access and system protection

Common operating systems include:
- Windows (Microsoft)
- macOS (Apple)
- Linux (Open Source)
- Android (Google)
- iOS (Apple)

Operating systems provide the foundation for all computing activities and serve as an interface between users and computer hardware.

# Linux over Windows

### Cost-Effectiveness
- **Free and Open Source**: Linux does not require expensive licensing fees, making it a cost-effective choice for companies.
- **Lower Maintenance Costs**: Linux is stable and requires minimal maintenance, reducing operational expenses.

### Performance and Efficiency
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Linux is lightweight and consumes fewer system resources compared to Windows.
- **High Scalability**: Linux efficiently scales from small embedded systems to enterprise data centers without performance degradation.

### Security and Reliability
- **Less Vulnerable to Malware**: Linux has strong user privilege separation, making it more secure against viruses and malware.
- **Frequent and Transparent Updates**: Regular security patches ensure system stability without requiring frequent reboots.
- **High Stability**: Linux systems can run for years without crashes, ensuring better uptime and reliability.
